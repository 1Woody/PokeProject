# Challenges Coding Exercise Backend

We have provided you with Pokemon data in a json file. Your mission is to create a database and expose the database to a API. Basically, you need to:

- Design the database to store information for the Pokemon data
- Load the database with the data
- Implement the API Interface with the user stories described below

### User Stories 

1. Obtain a pokemon by id
2. Obtain list of pokemons (TIP: pagination)
3. Obtain a pokemon by name
4. Obtain list of pokemons with different filters
5. Allow obtain pokemon types
6. Allow add a pokemon as favourite
7. Allow remove a pokemon as favourite
8. Allow obtain list of favourite pokemons

**Tests** are important

### Technology

Our technology stack is:

- Nest.js
- PostgreSQL / MongoDB

Be careful with your decisitions. You can use the framework that you prefer, but please write the challenge in JS or TS. You can choose MongoDB or PostgreSQL like database, be free but take in consideration the best database to store the data provided in the JSON file

### Evaluation

We will evaluate the next topics:

- **Funtional review**: The implementation does what was asked at the code challenge
- **Code structure**: Check if the code follows a good structure (Hexagonal Architecture, MVC Architecture, Layers Architecture, Domain Driven Design concepts,...)
- **Implementation details** (Design patterns, SOLID principles, DRY principle, YAGNI,...)
- **Code readability**
- **Evolutionary code**
- **Automated tests**
- **Documentation**: We are a remote team (explanation of why you take some decisions is important to us)

### Next steps

After the evaluation of the code challenge you will be notified. If we consider that you are ready for the next steps we will schedule some videocall meetings with some of our devs.
